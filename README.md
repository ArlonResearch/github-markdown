# GitHub Markdown Research

## Introduction
Since working with GitHub I have always been looking for the best way to document my work. One of the easiest and well-known ways to document things is to use Markdown. Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. GitHub has their own version of Markdown, which is called GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM). GFM is a superset of Markdown that adds additional features to the standard Markdown syntax. GFM is used in GitHub issues, comments, pull requests, and in the GitHub Pages publishing source.

This research is meant to explore the edges of GitHub's Markdown capabilities. I will be looking at the following topics:
- Mermaid

## Mermaid
Mermaid allows you to generate diagrams like flowcharts, sequence diagrams, and more using a simple markdown-like syntax inside Markdown files. Mermaid is a JavaScript library that can be used in the browser or with Node.js.

Read more about Mermaid [on the example page](./examples/mermaid.md).
